The image also exposes a `/data` volume that corresponds to the `persistentDir`.

Running the image is straightforward:

```
docker run --network host -it \
    -e USERNAME=user \
    -e PASSWORD=password \
    -e PORT=3000 \
    -v "$(PWD)"/data:/data \
    bropat/eufy-security-ws:latest
```

!>Note: In order for the local auto-discovery (udp broadcasting) of the respective station to work, it is recommended to operate the Docker container with the network mode `host`, otherwise the local discovery will not work and the cloud discovery must be resorted to._

Not recommended:

```
docker run -it \
    -e USERNAME=user \
    -e PASSWORD=password \
    -v "$(PWD)"/data:/data \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    bropat/eufy-security-ws:latest
```
